Unimelb Recording Finder
=======

###What does this do?###
 - This finds lecture recording links for unimelb's echo 360 system.
 - See `recordings.json` for raw output data, or `recordings.htm` for something more readable.

###How do I clear the cached data?###
 - Delete recordings.json, and it will fetch a brand new list.

###How do I run this?###
 - You need node.js, parse the app.js file into node.js, see Run.bat as an example.

###Do you keep an up to date list anywhere?###
 - [Ash47.net/recordings.htm] (http://ash47.net/recordings.htm) is usually up to date.
